Lead Tracker extention
This extension utilizes the local storage feature in web browsers to allow users to save URLs permanently. The saved URLs are stored in an array format, which is then converted into a string format for storage in local storage. The extension provides functionality for managing and accessing the saved URLs in array format by converting the string back to an array.
